## Project Title
NutriScan – Smart Food Calorie Scanner Mobile Application
## Introduction
Monitoring daily calorie intake is essential for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. However, estimating calories manually can be inconvenient and inaccurate, especially for individuals with busy schedules. Many existing applications require users to input food details manually, which reduces usability.

NutriScan aims to solve this problem by providing a mobile application that allows users to scan food items using a smartphone camera. The application analyzes the captured food image and displays an estimated calorie value using food recognition technology. This project is relevant as it promotes health awareness while demonstrating the practical application of mobile development and cloud technologies.
## Objectives
- To develop a mobile application that scans food images and estimates calorie values
- To provide a simple and user-friendly calorie tracking experience
- To store users’ food scan history using cloud-based storage
- To apply Flutter and Firebase technologies learned in the course
- To complete a functional mobile application within the given timeframe
## Target Users
- University students
- Individuals who want to monitor daily calorie intake
- Users who prefer a fast and simple food calorie estimation tool
